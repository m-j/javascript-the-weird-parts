function createCalculator(){
    var pi = 3.14; // pi variable will be accessible via closure

    return {
        circleArea: function (radius) {
            return pi * radius * radius;
        },
        circleCircumference: function (radius) {
            return 2 * pi * radius;
        }
    };
};

var calculator = createCalculator();
var area = calculator.circleArea(2);
console.log(area);
